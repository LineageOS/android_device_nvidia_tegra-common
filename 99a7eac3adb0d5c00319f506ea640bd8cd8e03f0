      "message": "Tegra extract fetches archives from nvidia, then extracts them to get the prebuilts. So 7z, brotli, and simg2img are needed. Previously, these scripts would ask for the user to build otatools first and got the tools from the build system out. This adds support for alternately using host copies instead. So extract can be run from non-build-tree working copy repos, or in a fresh tree that hasn\u0027t built the requisite binaries.",
